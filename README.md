# Hexglobe

Library to generate specific types of Goldberg polyhedra quickly and accurately. Avoids floating point arithmetic wherever possible to further this goal.

This library is primarily intended to address performance and precision issues I had using other similar libraries for a personal project. As such, there may be some oversights and design quirks which need to be fixed for other uses.

I welcome any issues, suggestions, or pull requests.
